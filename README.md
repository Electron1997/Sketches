# BayesianSketchLibrary

The library is in new/sketches. The implementation of the auxiliary sketches is still in new/prior_estimation, but I will move everything into the sketches folder soon. The documentation is not completely finished yet. I will fix everything very soon. The code in the other folders is just from experiments and stuff. I will probably remove a lot of the files. I will probably also remove the entire old folder which contains the old implementation and some profiling data about it.
